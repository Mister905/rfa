* Initialize front end / back end directories

npx create-react-app client

mkdir api


* Create and Activate Virtual Environment

cd api

python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate


* Deactivate Virtual Environment

deactivate


* Install python modules
* If python-dotenv is installed, running the flask command will set environment variables defined in the files .env and .flaskenv

~/rfa/api
venv ❯ pip install flask python-dotenv 


* Flask imports the application from the place indicated by the FLASK_APP environment variable. 
To avoid having to manually set this variable every time, create a .flaskenv file, which Flask automatically 
imports into the environment on startup if it finds the python-dotenv package installed.

~/rfa/api
venv ❯ touch .flaskenv

FLASK_APP=run.py
FLASK_ENV=development


* Initialize Flask app

~/rfa/api
venv ❯ touch __init__.py


* To complete the application, you need to have a Python script at the top-level that defines the Flask application instance. Let's call this script run.py, and define it as a single line that imports the application instance

~/rfa/api
venv ❯ touch run.py


* At this point this basic Flask project is complete. To make sure that it is working well you can start it

flask run


* React Proxy Configuration

* The React project can be configured to redirect any requests it receives on its port 3000 that it does not understand into another server. 
* This is configured simply by adding a proxy key at the bottom package.json:

/rfa/client/package.json

"proxy": "http://localhost:5000"

"scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject",
    "start_api": "cd ../api && venv/bin/flask run --no-debugger",
},

* Configure Project for Git

* Remove .git folder from create-react-app

~/rfa/client
venv ❯ sudo rm -rf .git

~/rfa/api
venv ❯ touch .gitignore

cd ..

~/rfa
venv ❯ echo "# rfa" >> README.md                                                                                                                                            
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin git@github.com:Mister905/rfa.git
git push -u origin main


~/rfa
venv ❯ git status                                                                                                                                                     ✭main

* Running the Combined Project

cd client

* Start Front End

yarn start

* Start Back End

yarn start_api


* pip freeze and install

* You can freeze requirements on one machine and then later on a different machine or on a clean environment 
* You'll get the an identical environment with the exact same dependencies installed as you had in the original 
* environment where you generated the frozen-requirements.txt

pip freeze > frozen-requirements.txt

pip install -r frozen-requirements.txt

Flask-SQLAlchemy, an extension that provides a Flask-friendly wrapper to the popular SQLAlchemypackage, which is an Object Relational Mapper or ORM. ORMs allow applications to manage a database using high-level entities such as classes, objects and methods instead of tables and SQL. The job of the ORM is to translate the high-level operations into database commands.

venv ❯ pip install flask-sqlalchemy


Flask-Migrate, which is actually one created by yours truly. This extension is a Flask wrapper for Alembic, a database migration framework for SQLAlchemy. Working with database migrations adds a bit of work to get a database started, but that is a small price to pay for a robust way to make changes to your database in the future.

venv ❯ pip install flask-migrate


SQLite databases are the most convenient choice for developing small applications, sometimes even not so small ones, as each database is stored in a single file on disk and there is no need to run a database server like MySQL and PostgreSQL.
